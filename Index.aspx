                Our Vision
            </h2>

            On Tuesday, 26th of September, 2017, His Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, issued a royal decree allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive cars. In support of this historic decree, and realizing its vision for women in Saudi Arabia, Princess Nourah University (PNU) took the lead in attaining the first driving school permit in the city of Riyadh from the General Department of Traffic. Through this school, PNU will provide high caliber training sessions to ensure that the first driving experience of women in the Kingdom would be in a safe and professional environment.
<p>
    The Saudi Driving School is the first institute in Riyadh to obtain a professional driver training permit for women. This school has been established in partnership with the Emirates Driving Institute in Dubai, which has been in the business of professional driver training in the region since 1991. The Saudi Driving School is also one of the biggest institutes in Saudi Arabia to train driving instructors.
    Our mission is to provide our trainees with the guidance to become skilled drivers. We also aim to spread a culture of safety in our community, because your safety comes first!
